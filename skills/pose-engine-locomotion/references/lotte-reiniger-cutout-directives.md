# Lotte Reiniger Cutout Directives

Use this when the goal is silhouette-first cutout animation inspired by Lotte Reiniger.

## Core Aesthetic Rules

1. Prioritize silhouette readability over interior detail.
- Every key pose must read as a flat black shape at a glance.
- Preserve clear negative space at elbows, knees, wrists, ankles, and neck.

2. Compose in profile and three-quarter silhouette.
- Favor lateral action and rotational arcs that keep limbs legible.
- Avoid front-on poses where left/right limbs merge into one mass.

3. Treat movement as lyrical, not snappy.
- Use smooth, musical timing curves and sustained follow-through.
- Favor transformation and drift over abrupt staccato cuts.

4. Use stylized backgrounds as stage planes.
- Keep characters dark and foregrounded against luminous/tinted backdrops.
- Let environment layers imply depth while preserving cutout flatness.

## Technical Method Translation (Local Digital Rig)

1. Build articulation as hinge chains.
- Keep clean pivot behavior at shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, wrists, ankles.
- Prefer constrained arcs over unconstrained freeform rotation.

2. Animate pose-to-pose, then polish with in-betweens.
- Block strong silhouette keys first.
- Add interpolation only after silhouette checks pass at each major beat.

3. Use scale-specific assets for close shots.
- For closeups, use alternate higher-detail overlays instead of scaling tiny assets excessively.
- Preserve contour fidelity in zoomed shots.

4. Simulate “trick table” depth with layer discipline.
- Separate character silhouettes, effects overlays, and color planes.
- Move layers independently for controlled parallax.

## Motion Grammar for Reiniger-Inspired Action

1. Walk
- Keep torso calm, legs and arms in elegant opposition.
- Use soft vertical bob and long limb arcs.

2. Jump
- Use clear anticipatory crouch, suspended apex, and graceful recovery.
- Keep the silhouette open at launch and landing.

3. Dash / travel bursts
- Use asymmetric leading/trailing limb shapes for directional clarity.
- Hold a readable directional line for at least one strong keyframe.

## Shot and Editing Language

1. Favor tableau staging.
- Treat each shot like a shadow-theatre panel with balanced composition.

2. Limit camera movement.
- Use deliberate pans/parallax only when it improves silhouette clarity.

3. Use transitions as graphic design.
- Wipes, dissolves, and shape-led transitions should preserve the cutout world logic.

## Quality Checklist

- Can the shot be understood in pure black silhouette without line art?
- Are all major joints readable as separate forms in key poses?
- Do timing accents track musical phrasing?
- Do effects (smoke, storms, magic) enhance silhouette contrast instead of obscuring it?
- Are closeup assets redrawn/re-authored instead of only scaled?
